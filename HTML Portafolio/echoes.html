			<h3>A first-person narrative puzzle experience about memory and grief</h3>
			<p><strong>Echoes of the Past</strong> is a short 3D game developed in Unity (URP) where players explore the abandoned house they once lived in, uncovering a fragmented story through interactive puzzles and subtle environmental storytelling. Using a pair of their late mother's glasses, players can shift between the present and a vivid past to solve puzzles and piece together what really happened.</p>

			<h4>About the project</h4>
			<p>
				The game's nostalgic and carefully crafted visual style is supported by strong environmental storytelling and puzzle design. The core mechanic—switching between past and present—adds emotional depth and unique gameplay moments. Over 95% of the assets were custom modeled and textured by the team, and all animations were created and implemented in-engine.
			</p>
			<p>
				Players encounter musical, visual, logic, and spatial puzzles, all integrated into the environment through exploration. The story is non-linear and revealed through cinematic moments, audio triggers, and object interactions, creating a layered narrative experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				The development process lasted 4 months, from concept to final build. The team used weekly Scrum-based sprints to stay organized and focused. The biggest challenge was achieving a high-quality visual finish while maintaining optimal performance with real-time lighting, high-resolution textures, post-processing, and detailed 3D models. We invested time learning and applying techniques like GPU instancing, occlusion culling, and efficient scene management to ensure a smooth experience.
			</p>

			<h4>My role in the development</h4>
			<p>
				I was the <strong>Lead Programmer</strong> and also contributed as a <strong>Technical Artist</strong>. I was responsible for implementing most of the game’s systems: player movement, all puzzle logic, audio triggers, scene transitions, and interactivity. I also helped integrate all artistic assets into Unity—applying shaders, setting up lighting and post-processing, and animating in-game cameras and sequences.
			</p>
			<p>
				Additionally, I supported the 3D artists by creating and texturing props, and ensured all elements worked together inside Unity as intended. We conducted multiple rounds of puzzle testing and feedback, including paper prototypes, which helped us simplify or rework complex puzzles that initially felt intuitive to us but were too difficult for players.

			<h4>What I took away from this project</h4>
			<p>
				Working on <em>Echoes of the Past</em> solidified my experience developing full games in Unity from the ground up. It allowed me to push my technical skills, especially in optimization, visual polish, and complex interactivity. Leading the programming efforts taught me how to manage pipelines, integrate team assets, and iterate based on real user feedback. I’m proud of how polished and emotionally resonant the final experience turned out to be.
			</p>
			<p>
				Moving forward, I’m excited to continue creating projects where gameplay and storytelling are deeply interconnected, ideally in narrative-driven or visually expressive games.
